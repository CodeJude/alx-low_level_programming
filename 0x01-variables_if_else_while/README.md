## C Programming Projects

Project 1: Positive or Negative
The 0-positive_or_negative.c program generates a random number and prints whether it is positive or negative, followed by a new line. The program stores a different random number each time it is run. If the number is greater than 0, it prints "is positive", if the number is 0, it prints "is zero", and if the number is less than 0, it prints "is negative".

Project 2: Last Digit
The 1-last_digit.c program generates a random number and prints the last digit, followed by a new line. The program stores a different value each time it is run. It then prints the string "Last digit of [number] is [last_digit]" and is followed by "greater than 5" if the digit is greater than 5, "0" if the digit is 0, or "less than 6 and not 0" if the digit is less than 6 and not 0.

Project 3: Alphabet Game
When insomnia strikes, play the alphabet game with the 2-print_alphabet.c program. It prints the lowercase alphabet, followed by a new line, using only the putchar function exactly twice.

Project 4: Alphabet Soup
The 3-print_alphabets.c program prints the alphabet in lowercase, then in uppercase, followed by a new line, using only the putchar function exactly three times. So get out your alphabet soup and start playing!

Project 5: AlphABET
The 4-print_alphabt.c program prints the alphabet in lowercase except for the letters 'q' and 'e', followed by a new line, using only the putchar function exactly twice.

Project 6: Numbers
The 5-print_numbers.c program prints all the single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.

Project 7: Numberz
The 6-print_numberz.c program prints all the single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line, using only the putchar function exactly twice, without any variables of type char.

Project 8: Smile in the Mirror
The 7-print_tebahpla.c program prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line, using only the putchar function exactly twice. Smile at yourself in the mirror while you do it!

Project 9: Hexadecimal
The 8-print_base16.c program prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line, using only the putchar function exactly three times. Get your hexadecimal fix with this program.

Project 10: Combinations
The 9-print_comb.c program prints all the possible combinations of single-digit numbers, using only the putchar function exactly four times, without any variables of type char. The numbers are separated by a comma followed by a space, and printed in ascending order.

Project 11: 00...99
The 10-print_comb2.c program prints the numbers from 00 to 99 using only the putchar function exactly five times, without any variables of type char. The numbers are separated by a comma followed by a space, and printed in ascending order, with two digits.

Project 12: Combination of Two Digits
The 100-print_comb3.c program prints all possible different combinations of two digits using only the putchar function exactly five times, without any variables of type char. The numbers are separated by a comma followed by a space, and printed in ascending order. The program prints only the smallest combination of two digits, and considers 01 and 10 as the same combination of the digits 0 and 1.

The 101-print_comb
