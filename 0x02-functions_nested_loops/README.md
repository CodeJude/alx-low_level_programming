Welcome to my collection of C programming challenges! In this repository, you will find a variety of functions and programs that will test and improve your skills as a C programmer.

Here are some of the challenges you can tackle:

_putchar: Write a program that prints "_putchar", followed by a new line, and returns 0. You can only use the _putchar function twice in your code.

print_alphabet: Write a function that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line. You can only use the _putchar function twice in your code.

print_alphabet_x10: Write a function that prints the alphabet in lowercase ten times, followed by a new line. You can only use the _putchar function twice in your code.

_islower: Write a function that checks if a character is lowercase. It should return 1 if the character is lowercase and 0 otherwise. You can use the standard library function islower to learn more about this concept.

_isalpha: Write a function that checks if a character is a letter, either lowercase or uppercase. It should return 1 if the character is a letter and 0 otherwise. You can use the standard library function isalpha to learn more about this concept.

sign: Write a function that prints the sign of a number and returns a value accordingly. If the number is greater than zero, it should return 1 and print "+". If the number is zero, it should return 0 and print "0". If the number is less than zero, it should return -1 and print "-".

abs: Write a function that returns the absolute value of an integer.

print_last_digit: Write a function that prints the last digit of a number and returns its value.

24_hours: Write a function that prints every minute of a day, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.

times_table: Write a function that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.

add: Write a function that returns the addition of two integers.

print_to_98: Write a function that prints all natural numbers from an input to 98, separated by a comma and a space.

times_table_advanced: Write a function that prints the times table of an input value, starting with 0. If the input is greater than 15 or less than 0, the function prints nothing.

sum_multiples: Write a program that computes and prints the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024.

fibonacci: Write a program that prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2, followed by a new line. The numbers should be separated by a comma and a space.

even_fibonacci: Write a program that prints the sum of all even-valued Fibonacci numbers not exceeding 4,000,000.

fibonacci_no_long_long: Write a program that prints the first 98 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2, followed by a new line. You cannot use long long, malloc, pointers, arrays, structures, or any library besides the standard. The numbers should be separated by a comma and a space.

Good luck with these challenges, and have fun improving your C programming skills!
