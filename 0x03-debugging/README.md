Welcome to this project where you will learn valuable skills in debugging code and problem-solving. By the end of this project, you will be able to explain the fundamentals of debugging and demonstrate various manual methods to identify and resolve errors in your code. Furthermore, you will learn how to read and interpret error messages accurately.

As a reminder, it is essential to adhere to copyright laws and avoid plagiarism by producing original work. You are required to come up with your own solutions to the following tasks without copying or publishing any part of this project.

The project requirements include using editors such as vi, vim, and emacs to write code that compiles on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, with specific options (-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89). Your code should follow the Betty style, which will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl. Additionally, you are to include a README.md file at the root of the repository, which provides an overview of the project, and another README.md file in the project's folder (i.e., 0x03-debugging), which describes the project's purpose.

Task 0 - Multiple mains (mandatory):
In this task, you will create a new file, 0-main.c, to test the positive_or_negative() function accurately. You are not required to create the function itself, but you can modify the one from the 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while - Task #0 project to work with this file. You must ensure that the function produces the correct output when given a case of 0. Only 0-main.c and main.h files are required for this task, and you are not allowed to add or remove any code. You may only modify one line.

Like, comment, subscribe (mandatory):
This task requires you to comment out the code causing an infinite loop in the provided main file. You are not permitted to add or remove any lines of code, and your line count will be checked.

Fix the print_remaining_days() function (mandatory):
This task requires you to modify the print_remaining_days() function to produce the correct output for all dates and leap years. You may assume that all test cases have valid months and days, but not all month/day/year combinations are valid. Line count will not be checked for this task.

0 > 972? (mandatory):
This task involves fixing the 2-largest_number.c code to produce the correct output for the largest of three numbers, regardless of the input. Line count will not be checked for this task.

Leap year (mandatory):
In this program, you will convert a date to the day of the year and determine how many days remain in the year, considering leap years.

By completing these tasks, you will gain valuable experience in debugging code, which is a crucial skill for any programmer.
