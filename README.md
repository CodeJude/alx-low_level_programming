# ALX Software Engineering Low-level Programming
This repository contains a collection of C programs developed as part of the ALX Software Engineering low-level programming curriculum.

## C Programming Basics
### Why C Programming is Awesome
C is an important programming language used for a wide range of applications, including operating systems, compilers, and embedded systems. It is known for its performance, efficiency, and low-level control. In this project, you will learn about the basics of C programming and how to use it to build high-quality software.

### Who invented C
C was invented by Dennis Ritchie in the early 1970s while working at Bell Labs. Ritchie created C as a low-level language that could be used to build operating systems and other complex systems.

### Who are Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan and Linus Torvalds
Dennis Ritchie is the creator of C and one of the key figures in the development of Unix. Brian Kernighan is a computer scientist who worked with Ritchie on the development of C and Unix. Linus Torvalds is the creator of the Linux operating system, which is written in C and inspired by Unix.

### What happens when you type gcc main.c
When you type "gcc main.c", the gcc compiler reads the "main.c" file and translates it into an executable program that can be run on your computer. The compiler performs a number of operations, including preprocessing, compiling, and linking.

### What is an entry point
The entry point is the location in a program where the execution begins. In C programs, the entry point is the "main" function.

### What is main
"main" is a special function in C programs that serves as the entry point. The main function is where the execution of the program begins and it is where you should put the code that you want to run.

### How to print text using printf, puts and putchar
You can print text in C programs using several functions. The most commonly used functions are "printf", "puts", and "putchar". These functions allow you to print text to the console or to a file.

### How to get the size of a specific type using the unary operator sizeof
You can use the "sizeof" operator in C to determine the size of a particular type. For example, you can use "sizeof(int)" to determine the size of an integer.

### How to compile using gcc
You can compile C programs using the "gcc" compiler. To compile a program, you should use the "gcc" command followed by the name of the source file, like this: "gcc main.c".

### What is the default program name when compiling with gcc
When you compile a C program using "gcc", the default name for the resulting executable program is "a.out".

### What is the official ALX C coding style and how to check your code with betty-style
The official ALX C coding style is a set of guidelines for writing high-quality C programs. The guidelines cover aspects such as naming conventions, indentation, and formatting. You can check your code against the ALX C coding style using the "betty-style" checker.

### How to find the right header to include in your source code when using a standard library function
Standard library functions in C require that you include the appropriate header file in your program. You can find the right header to include by consulting the documentation for the standard library function.

### How does the main function influence the return value of the program
The return value of the main function determines the exit status of the program. A return value of 0 indicates that the program exited successfully
