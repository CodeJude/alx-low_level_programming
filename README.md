## Welcome to the world of C programming!

Welcome to the world of C programming! In this README file, we'll explore the awesome features of the C programming language. Don't forget to tweet about it today with the hashtag #cisfun!

C programming was invented in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie. It was developed at Bell Labs for the purpose of writing the Unix operating system. Over the years, C has become one of the most popular programming languages in the world.

Three key figures in the development of C are Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan, and Linus Torvalds. Ritchie and Kernighan wrote the first book on C programming, called "The C Programming Language," which is still considered a classic today. Torvalds, on the other hand, used C to write the Linux operating system.

When you type "gcc main.c" in the terminal, the C source code in "main.c" is compiled into an executable file. The "gcc" command is the GNU Compiler Collection, which is a compiler for several programming languages, including C. The resulting executable file is then ready to be executed.

In C programming, the "entry point" is the location in the code where the program begins execution. The entry point in a C program is the "main" function, which is where the program begins its execution. The "main" function is a required part of every C program.

To print text in C, you can use several functions, including "printf," "puts," and "putchar." The "printf" function is the most commonly used function to print text. It allows you to format the text in a specific way, such as including numbers or variables. The "puts" function is used to print a string of characters, while the "putchar" function is used to print a single character.

To determine the size of a specific data type in C, you can use the unary operator "sizeof." This operator returns the number of bytes that are required to store a specific data type.

To compile C code using "gcc," you need to run the command "gcc filename.c -o outputfile," where "filename.c" is the name of the source file and "outputfile" is the name of the resulting executable file. By default, the resulting program will be named "a.out."

The official Holberton C coding style is designed to make code easy to read and understand. To check your code against this style, you can use the "betty-style" and "betty-doc" tools. These tools will analyze your code and provide suggestions for improving its style and readability.

When using a standard library function in C, you need to include the appropriate header file in your source code. For example, to use the "printf" function, you need to include the "stdio.h" header file.

The main function in a C program is responsible for returning a value that indicates whether the program completed successfully or not. By convention, a value of 0 is returned to indicate success, while a value other than 0 indicates an error or failure.

To write C code for this project, you can use any of the following editors: vi, vim, or emacs. Your code will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using gcc 4.8.4, so make sure your code is compatible with this environment. Additionally, make sure your code follows the Betty style, as it will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl. Good luck!
